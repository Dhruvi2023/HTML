    QUE 1: What are the new tags added in HTML5?
    ANS  :     As we know that HTML5 is a new version of HTML ( Hypertext markup language). HTML5 introduced many new tags that will benefit many developers. These tags are generally supported by all major browsers. These tags belong to many aspects such as graphics, media, and forms.

                      List of all elements introduced in HTML5:

    ~ <article> tag: The <article> tag is one of the new sectioning element in HTML5. The HTML <article> tag is used to represent an article. More specifically, the content within the <article> tag is independent of the other content of the site (even though it can be related).

    ~ <aside> tag: The <aside> tag is used to describe the main object of the web page in a shorter way like a highlighter. It basically identifies the content that is related to the primary content of the web page but does not constitute the main intent of the primary page.

    ~ <figure> tag: The <figure> tag in HTML is used to add self-contained content like illustrations, diagrams, photos, or codes listing in a document. It is related to the main flow, but it can be used in any position of a document and the figure goes with the flow of the document and if remove it then it should not affect the flow of the document. This tag is new in HTML5.

    ~ <footer> tag: The <footer> tag in HTML is used to define a footer of HTML document. This section contains the footer information (author information, copyright information, carriers, etc). The footer tag is used within the body tag. The <footer> tag is new in the HTML5. The footer elements require a start tag as well as an end tag.

    ~ <header> tag: The <header> tag contains information related to the title and heading of the related content. The <header> element is intended to usually contain the section’s heading (an h1-h6 element or an <hgroup> element), but this is not required.The <header> element can also be used to wrap a section’s table of contents, a search form, or any relevant logos. The <header> tag is a new tag in HTML5 and it requires a starting tag as well as an end tag. There can be several <header> elements in one document. A <header> tag cannot be placed within a <footer>, <address> or another <header> element.

    ~ <hgroup> tag: The <hgroup> tag in HTML stands for heading group and is used to group the heading elements.

    ~ <keygen> tag: The <keygen> tag in HTML is used to specify a key-pair generator field in a form. The purpose of the<keygen> element is to provide a secure way to authenticate users. When a form is submitted then two keys are generated, private key and public key. The private key is stored locally, and the public key is sent to the server. The public key is used to generate a client certificate to authenticate a user for the future.

    ~ <nav> tag: The <nav> tag is used for declaring the navigational section in HTML documents. Websites typically have sections dedicated to navigational links, which enables users to navigate the site. These links can be placed inside a nav tag. In other words, the nav element represents a section of the page whose purpose is to provide navigational links, either in the current document or to another document. The links in the nav element may point to other web pages or to different sections of the same webpage. It is a semantic element. Common examples of the nav elements are menus, tables, contents, and indexes.

The section tag is used when requirements of two headers or footers or any other section of documents are needed. The <section> tag grouped the generic block of related contents. The main advantage of the section tag is, it is a semantic element, which describes its meaning to both browser and developer.

    QUE 2: How to embed audio and video in webpage?
    ANS  :      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. It is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. HTML uses predefined tags and elements that tell the browser how to properly display the content on the screen. So, in this article, we will learn how to embed audio and video in HTML. In order to insert multimedia files on web pages, we already know how to insert images in HTML. 

                       # How to embed audio in HTML?

          To embed audio in HTML, we use the <audio> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is possible. This tag supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge in three audio formats – MP3, WAV, OGG. Only Safari browser doesn’t support OGG audio format.

                               ~ SYNTAX ~

                               <audio>
                                <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
                            </audio>
                            
                       # How to embed video in HTML?

         To embed video in HTML, we use the <video> tag. It contains one or more video sources at a time using <source> tag. It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. Only Ogg video format doesn’t support in Safari browser. 

                               ~ SYNTAX ~

                               <video>
                                <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
                            </video>

    QUE 3: semantic element in HTML5?
    ANS  :     A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

    Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
    
    Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
    
                               ~ Semantic Elements in HTML ~

    Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.

    In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  
                                
                                <article>
                                <aside>
                                <details>
                                <figcaption>
                                <figure>
                                <footer>
                                <header>
                                <main>
                                <mark>
                                <nav>
                                <section>
                                <summary>
                                <time>

                         ~ HTML <section> Element ~

            The <section> element defines a section in a document.
                                        
            According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."
                                        
            Examples of where a <section> element can be used:

                            ~ Introduction
                            ~ News items
                            ~ Contact information

            A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.
                                        
                           (1) HTML <article> Element
                The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
                
                An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.
                
                Examples of where the <article> element can be used:
                
                              ~ Forum posts

                              ~ Product cards
                              ~ Newspaper articles

                           (2) HTML <header> Element
               The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
                            
                A <header> element typically contains:
                            
                             ~ one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
                             ~ logo or icon
                             ~ authorship information

                       ~ sitemap
                       ~ back to top links
                       ~ related documents
                       ~ You can have several <footer> elements in one document.

    QUE 4: Canvas and SVG tags.... 
    ANS  :      SVG: The Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based image format that is used to define two-dimensional vector-based graphics for the web. Unlike raster image (Ex .jpg, .gif, .png, etc.), a vector image can be scaled up or down to any extent without losing the image quality.

    An SVG image is drawn out using a series of statements that follow the XML schema — that means SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, such as Notepad. There are several other advantages of using SVG over other image formats like JPEG, GIF, PNG, etc.

               Canvas: The HTML element is used to draw graphics on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics. Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
