                         MODULE 1: HTML


    QUE 1: Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
    ANS  : HTML elements and tags are a lot different. Let’s see what HTML elements and Tags actually are and their differences. The below image tells about HTML Elements and HTML Tags.
                        HTML Elements
  The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
              Examples of some HTML elements:
                <h1>My First Heading</h1>
                <p>My first paragraph.</p>


    
    QUE 2: What are tags and attributes in HTML?
    ANS  :              HTML Attributes
         ~ All HTML elements can have attributes
         ~ Attributes provide additional information about elements
         ~ Attributes are always specified in the start tag
         ~ Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

                        HTML TAG
        An HTML tag is commonly defined as a set of characters constituting a formatted command for a Web page. At the core of HTML, tags provide the directions or recipes for the visual content that one sees on the Web.
          
              Here Are A Few Common HTML Tags And Their Uses:

         (1) Heading tags:
             Every document has a heading. Your headings might be different sizes. The headings in HTML are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6. A line is added before and after each heading.

         (2) Paragraph tags: 
             The p tag allows you to divide your text into paragraphs. A p tag should separate each paragraph of text.

        (3)  Line break Tags:
             Whenever you employ the <br/> element, the next line begins. You can create an empty part using this tag, with no opening or closing tags required.
             Space is between the hr and the forward-slash in hr/. Older browsers will have problems rendering the horizontal line without this space, and using hr without the forward-slash character is not valid XHTML.

        (4)  Formating tags:
             Sometimes you want your text to look exactly like the HTML content. Use the preformatted tag <pre> in these circumstances. 



     QUE 3: What are void elements in HTML? With Example.
     ANS  : Most of the HTML elements are surrounded by start and end tags to specify the starting and end   of the element.
     There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it, these elements are called void elements. Void elements doesn’t have ending tags and can only have attributes but do not contain any kind of content. These elements can have backslash before ending of start tag but that is completely optional. Example of such elements are <br>, <hr>, <img>, <input>, <link>, <base>, <meta>, <param>, <area>, <embed>, <col>, <track>, <source> etc.

                          Characteristics:
                ~ Void elements do not have end tags.
                ~ Void elements cannot have content inside it.
                ~ Void elements have attributes.
                ~ Void elements cannot be nested.
     A void element is an element in HTML that cannot have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes). Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.

           # EXAMPLE:-

 (1)     <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>

       <body>
            <h2 style="color:green">GeeksforGeeks</h2>
            <p>Hi Geeks! <br>Welcome to GeeksforGeeks</p>

       </body>
       </html>

  (2)     <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>

        <body>       
            <p>Welcome to GeeksforGeeks</p>
            <hr>        
            <p>A computer science portal for geeks</p>

        </body>    
        </html>                    



     QUE 4: What are HTMl entities? With Example.
     ANS  :  The HTML entities are used to display reserved characters (characters that are used in HTML code), special characters, or invisible characters. 

           # EXAMPLE:-

      (1)     <p>This is a &lt;p&gt; tag.</p>  
      
      (2)     <!DOCTYPE html>
              <html>
               <body>
                    <h2>GeeksforGeeks</h2>
                    <div class="container">
                         <h3>Different entity symbol representation</h3>
                         <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                                <li>
                                   <h4>Indian currency: ₹</h4>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                   <h4>Euro: €</h4>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                   <h4>Pound: £</h4>
                                 </li>
                                <li>
                                   <h4>Yen: ¥</h4>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                   <h4>Dollar: $</h4>
                            </li>
